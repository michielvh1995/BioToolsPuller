# Biotools Puller
This is a simple tool I made during my thesis, used to download and prepare tool annotation data en masse from Bio.Tools.

The tool annotation data, once pulled, can be exported to a json file using the Extractor.

## Requester
The Requester class is used to make data requests to bio.tools

## Extractor
The Extractor class is used to clean the bio.tools data and to prepare it for being usable for my thesis.
